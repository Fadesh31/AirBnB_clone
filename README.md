HTML and CSS concepts
Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive! Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

No data loaded from anything During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write.
